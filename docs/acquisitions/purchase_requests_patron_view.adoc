Placing purchase requests from a patron record
----------------------------------------------

indexterm:[patrons, purchase requests]

Patrons may wish to suggest titles for your Library to purchase.  You can track these requests within Evergreen,
whether or not you are using the acquisitions module for other purposes.  This section describes how you can record
these requests within a patron's record.

. Retrieve the patron's record.

. Select Other --> Acquisition Requests. This takes you to the Requests Screen.

. The Requests Screen will show any other requests that this patron has made.  You may sort the requests by clicking on the column headers.

. To add the request, click the _Create Request_ button.
+
NOTE: You will need the CREATE_PURCHASE_REQUEST permission to add a request.
+
. The request type field is required.  Every other field is optional, although it is recommended that you enter as much information about the
request as possible.

. The _Pickup Library_, _User_, and _Request Date/Time_ field will be filled in automatically.

. You have the option to automatically place a hold for the patron if your library decides to purchase the item.  If you'd like Evergreen to
generate this hold, check the _Place Hold_ box.

. When you have finished entering information about the request, click the _Save_ button.
