indexterm:[Check-boxes, sticky settings]

Most staff client check-boxes are ``sticky'' -- if you select or deselect
them, that status persists. For example, *Auto-Print*, which will print
the relevant receipts automatically in certain functions, is sticky. If
you select it on one login, it will persist for future logins until you
uncheck the box.

*Fast Item Add* is another ``sticky'' check box that makes it possible to
add volume and item records from the MARC editor.
